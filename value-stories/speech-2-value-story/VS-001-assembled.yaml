goal:
  as_a: As a AVS Solution Architect
  i_want: 'Analyze a raw ''Discovery Interview'' transcript and compile it into a
    valid, executable AVS Value Story (.md) that strictly follows the ''vs-000-template.md''
    structure.

    '
  so_that: 'Non-technical users can simply ''speak'' their intentions (via the interview)
    and have them automatically converted into precise, algorithmically legible agent
    instructions without learning YAML syntax.

    '
instructions:
  reasoning_pattern: Chain-of-Thought
  execution_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    action: Analyze the 'transcript' asset. Extract the user's answers regarding the
      'Goal' (The Why), 'Inputs' (Context), 'Process' (Instructions), and 'Output'
      (Product).
    validation_rule: The 4 core components of the user's intent are clearly identified.
  - step_number: 2
    action: 'Map the extracted intent into the ''vs_template'' structure: 1. Map ''Goal''
      answers to the ''goal:'' YAML block (as_a, i_want, so_that). 2. Map ''Inputs''
      to the ''context_manifest:'' YAML block (key, description, default_path). 3.
      Map ''Process'' to the ''instructions:'' YAML block (create logical execution_steps).
      4. Map ''Output'' to the ''product:'' YAML block.'
    validation_rule: Every piece of the user's intent is mapped to a valid field in
      the template schema.
  - step_number: 3
    action: Generate the final Markdown file. Ensure it includes the standard headers
      (# VS-XXX...) and correctly formatted YAML code blocks. Do not summarize the
      template structure; preserve the YAML syntax exactly.
    validation_rule: The output is a valid Markdown file that would pass 'avs validate'.
